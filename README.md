# Design Inspirations

A curated collection of beautiful UI patterns and components, brought to life from bookmarked designs across the web.

## About

I find myself bookmarking dozens of incredible pages, components, and prototypes every day. This repository brings those designs to life for others to explore, learn from, and use.

### Goals

- **Appreciate great design** — Showcase exceptional UI work from talented designers
- **Light & Dark modes** — Every design includes both light and dark variants
- **Mobile-first** — Alternative layouts for mobile when the design requires it
- **AI-powered development** — A comprehensive set of frontend [Skills](.claude/skills) to help AI agents create better user interfaces

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **React 19** with ViewTransition API
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **TypeScript**
- **Bun** as the package manager and runtime

## Skills for AI Agents

This repository includes a layered skills system in `.claude/skills/` designed to improve AI-assisted frontend development:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `component-variants` | Foundation for creating light/dark mode component pairs with consistent color token mapping |
| `expandable-card` | UI pattern for smooth expand/collapse animations using CSS grid-rows |
| `create-new-design` | Project scaffolding for adding new designs with preview, detail page, and main page entry |

These skills are portable — copy them to your own repositories to enhance AI agent capabilities.

## Request a Design

Have a design you'd love to see brought to life? [Create an issue](https://github.com/ainergiz/design-inspirations/issues/new) with a link or screenshot of the design.

## Contributing

This is a personal project and I'm not accepting contributions at this time. Feel free to fork and adapt for your own use.

## Easter Egg

Check out the smooth page transitions using React 19's experimental [ViewTransition API](https://react.dev/reference/react/ViewTransition) — navigate from the main page to any design to see it in action.
